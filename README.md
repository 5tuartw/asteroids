During this project I developed the following skills:
- Setup and instal Pygame
- Create classes of object that interact with each other in the game space

## Notes
To create a virtual environment to run the application:
```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```

Then create a file requirements.txt and type
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
